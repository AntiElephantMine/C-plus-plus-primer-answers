When a class is instantiated the compiler generates a specific class type from the template
where the template parameters are replaced by the template arguments in the member declarations
and definitions. Member functions are not instantiated if the program does not call them
and each instantiation of a class has its own version of each member. Hence member functions 
are defined as function templates.
