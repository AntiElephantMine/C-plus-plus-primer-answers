Vector has many constructors that use the default constructor of its element type.

For instance 

vector<string> a(10);

Uses the string default constructor to create 10 default-initialised strings.


However when explicitly instantiating a class all the member functions are defined. If NoDefault
were the element type the constructor that took a single int would be defined but it requires use
of NoDefault's default constructor, which does not exist. Hence it is not possible to explicitly 
instantiate such a class.
