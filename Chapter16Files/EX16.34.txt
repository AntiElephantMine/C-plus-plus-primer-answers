No, "hi" causes T to be of type char array of size 3 whereas "world" causes T to be of type

Fine, the types match (T is char array of size 4).

a) fine, T deduced as type char, 'c' is converted to int
b) fine, T is deduced as type double, f is converted to int
c) fine, T deduced as type char
d) error, T cannot either double or float so an error is caused
