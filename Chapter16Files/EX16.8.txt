Most types support !=. It is easy conceptually to define an equality operator for a type.

On the other hand < may be an ambiguous operation for most types and so won't be defined as often.

As a result, using != instead of < means we do not have to worry too much about the type we are using
in our code. It also allows our templates to achieve a greater type independence.
