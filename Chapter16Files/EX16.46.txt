alloc.constructor(dest++, std::move(*elem++)) will more than likely do a command like

    string s(std::move(*elem++))

in order to create a string in the new memory. All that happens here is the string lvalue returned from *elem++ is passed
to the template function std::move and std::move<string&> is instantiated, which returns an explcitly casted rvalue
reference to the lvalue that was passed. The move-constructor then uses this rvalue to extract the properties ("clobber") from
*elem++ in order to construct s. 

The details of the loop are not really important to the purpose of the question.
