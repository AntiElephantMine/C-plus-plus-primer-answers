Yes it's legal, but it places a constraint on the fact that the type returned from the dereference
has a type with operator+ defined for integer literals as the right hand operand. 

The return type is whatever element type the expression *beg+0 yields. Presumably this would be the
element (not reference) type of *beg. However that is not always the case. For instance *beg may be of 
type char&, then decltype(*beg+0) return int as the char is promoted, so the return type is int. This isn't
desirable or generic behaviour and probably would not be a good idea.
