Advantages of variadic errorMsg:

1) We can have arguments of varying type and number.
2) More flexible use. 


Disadvantages of variadic errorMsg:

1) Inherently more complicated approach.
2) A heck of a lot more verbose, print functions are needed, debug_rep function templates
are needed, etc.
3) In combination with above, our program may not function correctly if we did not
include template declarations at the right place. 





Advantages of initializerList errorMsg:

1) Much simpler approach.

Disadvantages of initializerList errorMsg:

1) We can only have a varying number of arguments for a pre-defined type, probably string.
