a) CADVehicle multiply inherits from CAD and Vehicle. It publicly interits from CAD and privately (implicitly) inherits from Vehicle. 

b) Error, a base class may only appear once in the derivation list.

Mi beings by running the C default constructor, which in turn begins by running the B default constructor
which in turn begins by running the A constructor. Once the A constructor is finished, the B constructor
continues running and finishes, and then the C constructor continues running and finishes.

Next, mi runs the Z default constructor which in turn begins by running the X default constructor. Once the X constructor 
finishes the Z constructor then begins the Y default constructor. When the Y constructor finishes the Z constructor continues
running and finishes.

Finally, once the Z constuctor finishes the MI default constructor continues and finishes.

So the order of subpart construction is;

A -> B -> C -> X -> Y -> Z -> MI
