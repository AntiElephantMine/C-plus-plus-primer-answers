We can use unnamed spaces to keep variables local to the file. 

We may have variables that we wish to be used by multiple functions in the same file, and so we declare
it in the global namespace. When we declare a non-const variable in the global namespace there may be linker 
errors as we compile with other source files that have variables of the same name that are also in global scope. 
By placing these variables in unnamed namespaces we ensure they are "inivisible" outside of the source file.

In general, unnamed namespaces are intended to prevent name clashes of global names across source files.
This prevents accidentally violating the one definition rule and causing linker errors.
