A using declaration is like declaring an alias for a namespace member in the scope of the
declaration. As a result, like defining any alias, any name conflicts that occur with other 
definitions in the scope are detected straight away.

A using directive "brings" the namespace in to the scope of the directive. Well, not quite,
since in general a namespace could include definitions which cannot appear in local scope, so
it brings it in to the first common namespace ancestor of that namespace and the scope of 
the directive statement. Name conflicts between names from the injected namespace and the scope
it was injected in to are permitted (unlike declarations), but it is ambiguous to use such a name 
without qualification by a scope operator.
