18.28)

Without qualification:

Bar. This name is overriden only once, by the class Derived1. So this one (void bar(char)) is
found by name lookup when Bar is used without qualification.

ival. The name is overriden only once, by the class Derived2. So this one is found by name lookup
when ival is used without qualification. 







With qualification:

cval. It is defined in both Derived1 and Derived2, which VMI inherits directly from. Hence this
is ambiguous (by 18.3.3) without qualification.

foo. It is defined in both Derived1 and Derived2, which VMI inherits directly from. Hence this
is ambiguous (by 18.3.3) without qualification.
