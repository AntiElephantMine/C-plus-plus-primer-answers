Candidate:

All the computes, even those from primerLib, are candidate functions.



Viable:

compute(const void*)
compute(int)
compute(double, double = 3.4)
compute(char*, char* = 0)

are the viable functions.




Converions


compute(const void*) requires pointer conversion
compute(int) requires no conversion
compute(double, double = 3.4) requires arithmetic conversion
compute(char*, char* = 0) requires pointer conversion


compute(int) gets chosen






"What would happen if the using declaration were located in main before the call
to compute? Answer the same questions as before." - I'll assume he meant located in "f()", not main.

In this case the compute functions from primerLib get brought in to scope and hide the existing 
declarations for that name in the outer scope.

Candidate:

compute()
compute(const void*)



Viable:

compute(const void*)


This one gets chosen^.
