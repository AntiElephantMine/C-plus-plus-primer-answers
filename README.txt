These are my personal answers for the great book C++ Primer, 5th Edition by Stanley B. Lippman/Josée Lajoie/Barbara E.Moo.

Some answers are not provided, particularly in the earlier chapters. Either I deemed they were easy enough to go without saying, or they were explanation-based questions which I reasoned about in my head and didn't write down. By the later chapters I attempt to provide my answer for every question.

Some chapters require modification of a class as you progress through the exercises. I only have a single version of each class in the Chapter files which correspond to the final modification of the class in that chapter.

THIS WAS NOT INTENDED FOR GITHUB USE! I didn't even know about Github before starting C++. As a result, some of the variable names or string literals used may be offensive and unprofessional and I apologise for this in advance. If you find anything of the sort please let me know. There are some 350 files I would have had to check through myself. 

I have published this with the intent that people may cross-check their answers with mine. 

I'm not interested in editing the code in these answers so the programs are 100% efficient and effective. I am only interested in answering the question asked, but if an answer to a question is just plain wrong (or if it works but misses the purpose of the question), please let me know.
