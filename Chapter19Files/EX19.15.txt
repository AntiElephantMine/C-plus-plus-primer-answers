Similar to member question:

An ordinary function pointer holds the address of an object contained within the program.

A pointer to member function does not hold an function's address, dereferencing it does not 
provide a function we can call. Instead a pointer to member function holds an "identification" 
of a member function, dereferencing a pointer-to-member when we also supply a class object calls (if
we supply the call operator) the function to which the pointer identifies.

Another main difference is that there is no automatic conversion between a member function and a pointer
to that member, unlike ordinary function pointers. We must explictly supply the address-of operator & to
a member function.

Slight difference is that we must supply const or reference qualifiers to the type of function-pointers
if necessary.
