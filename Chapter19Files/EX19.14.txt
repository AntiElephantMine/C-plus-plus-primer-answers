This should be fine.

auto pmf = &Screen::get_cursor deduces the type of auto as "char Screen::*() const" and sets pmf to the address of
Screen::get_cursor.

Next:

pmf = &Screen::get

Although get is overloaded, the address of the zero-argument version of get is assigned to pmf because it has 
the same type as pmf and Screen::get_cursor. Both return char, have zero arguments and are const member functions.
