If we copy:

If discrim is currently STR, then the string sval is copy-assigned by itself.
If discrim is currently SDA, then the Sales_data sales is copy-assigned by itself.

Then discrim is copy assigned by itself.

No destruction will happen because the values of discrim in LHS and RHS are equal. 



If we move:

Nothing happens, we check for self-assignment and do nothing.
