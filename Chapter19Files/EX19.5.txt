It is always best to define a virtual function rather than using dynamic casts. However dynamic casts 
are needed when we need to call a derived class member function that, for whatever reason, we cannot make 
virtual and the pointer/reference we wish to call it from has (we suspect) a dynamic type of this derived 
class.
