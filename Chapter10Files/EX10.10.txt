Because the algorithms work on iterators, not containers, and so cannot directly change the size of the container.

Why do they work with iterators? So that the algorithms can be as general as possible and work with all container types.

Also any method an algorithm would use to change the size of a container could limit its use to certain containers. i.e. if an algorithm were to use
push_front then it means it cannot work with vectors. It might hard to change container size while also being general and inclusive to all container types.
