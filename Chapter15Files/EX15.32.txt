Query:

No copy control members are defined. As a result we get synthesised versions.

 
Copy: Will simply copy the shared_ptr across. Reference count of shared_ptr is increased.
Assign: Will simply assign the shared_ptr. Reference count of shared_ptr is increased.
Move: Will simply move the shared_ptr. New shared_ptr points to old. Reference count remains same. (in both constructor/assign cases).
Destruct: Will destruct the shared_ptr. Decreasing reference count. 



Query_base:

Destructor was defined. Therefore the move constructor/assignment operators will not be synthesised. Nor will the derived classes have move operations.

Query_base objects destruct/copy-construct/copy-assign with default behaviour. Although Query_base has no data members
so the copy operations do no work.
