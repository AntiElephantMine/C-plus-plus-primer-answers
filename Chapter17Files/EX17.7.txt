The method using a struct seems a bit unnecessary, the struct will only be used in this specific circumstance and never again, better to use a "quick and dirty" data structure" like tuple or pair. 

The method using a pair probably makes the most sense. The second element is another pair which indicates that those elements are strongly related and connected - which is true since they are starting and ending iterators for a vector. How the second and third elements are related is not indicated by the tuple and it just having three independent elements.

It also feels natural to iterate through the vector using the pair members first and second than get<i>(x). 

However it would be a pain to restructure the code using the pairs if we ever decide we need a fourth member to use.

Really though, these are the only differences and it doens't matter too much which is used.
