I think the original design is better

1) By designing it as a class we can add and use member functions naturally. In this case we have to define
ordinary functions (such as begin and end) to do operations that we would normally expect member functions to
supply.

2) We would have to supply information with textQuery about the nature of queryResult. i.e. we might have to 
tell them it's a tuple that holds a set of linenumbers (so they can understand what the begin and end functions
actually do).

3) Might be harder to change the design of queryResult, e.g. if we wanted to add another data member. 




However this design is simpler in that it requires less code and deals with the implementation of less classes.
