a) bitset<64> bitvec(32)

bitvec represents 64 bits. 32 is an integer literal of value with bit representation of 10000. Whatever the size
of integer literals this gets converted to an unsigned long-long. So bitvec is the has low-order bit pattern 10000 and the higher order bits are zero.


b) bitset<32> bv(1010101) 

bv represents 32 bits. I guess the point here is that one might expect bv to be set to the bit pattern
1010101 (the integer 85). Except 1010101 is an integer literal, and will be converted to its 21-bit representation
of 011110110100110110101. The remaining 11 higher-order bits are set to 0.

c) This will use the string constructor to create an 8-bit representation. However if bstr has any character
other than '1' or '0' it will throw an invalid_argument error. If bstr consists of just 1 and 0, then the first 8 characters of bstr will inversely create the lower-order bits of bv. If there are less than 8 characters in bv then 
the higher-order bits of bv are set to 0.
