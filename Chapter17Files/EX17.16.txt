If we used just [^c]ei instead then you probably would not notice too much, but:

If we were to use a smatch object then the str() member would only get matched to the [^c]ei part and
not the alphanumeric characters before and after those three characters. e.g. weird would output "wei"

We could add anything before and after [^c]ei and it would work. E.g. 9294wei9231 would return
"violates the rule" even though it's not a word.
