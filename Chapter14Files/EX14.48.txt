What would bool for Date or Book test? At best false could be returned if a Date or Book is the default value, and true otherwise, but for what reason? This could be a hinderance for some designed programs. It is not immediately clear what a bool conversion would entail, and so it might be best not to define it. 


Regardless conversions to bool should normally be explicit to avoid unwanted arithmetic converisons. As explained
in 14.9.1.
