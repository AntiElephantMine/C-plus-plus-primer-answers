when you would use lambdas (and why the standard added them)

- short temporary code used to serve as a temporary function to pass as a function-object parameter
- presents inner workings of function process to user
- to stop creating classes for simple processes which be only used once, for instance in EX14.40 it was wasteful
and verbose to create 3 classes for processes used only once

when you would use classes

- for functions with many processes that would not be ideal for the intended short style of lambdas
- more permanent solution if we wish to re-use the function process multiple times
- to change the inner workings of the function over time by changing data members (lambda can technically do this
by changing capture'd variables at different times but classes keep data members neatly contained within a single object)
