two ways

s1 could convert to int, then operator+(int, double)

3.14 could convert to int, then to s1, then two low-level const conversion to const SmallInt&, operator+(const SmallInt&, const SmallInt&)

- In a call to an overloaded function, the rank of an additional standard conversion (if any) matters 
only if the viable functions require the same user defined conversion. If different user-defined 
conversions are needed, then the call is ambiguous.

So it should be ambiguous according to this^

Explicitly cast s1 to double

double d = double(s1) + 3.14;
Or alternatively cast 3.14 to smallInt
